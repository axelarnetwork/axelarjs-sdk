# AxelarJS SDK

## Overview

The Axelar JS SDK was created to abstract a set of tools used to make requests into the Axelar Network.

One of our early use cases is a simple transfer of crypto assets across any of our supported chains.

Day 1, this will include:

| All Supported Assets  | All Supported Blockchain Networks |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Axelar native tokens, aUST, UST (Terra stablecoin), LUNA (Terra native tokens)  | Avalanche, Axelar, Ethereum, Fantom, Polygon, Terra |

The list will continue to grow, as will the use cases of this SDK. 

Thank you for your support!

## Note
This SDK repo is still in early development. 

Please let us know of any issues you encounter using the SDK. 

## Installation

```bash
npm i --save @axelar-network/axelarjs-sdk
```

## Getting Started

You can use something like the following snippets to first set up the library consumer and then to instantiate it

For initial setup:
```tsx
import {
    IAssetInfoWithTrace,
    IAssetTransferObject,
    ICallbackStatus,
    TransferAssetBridge
} from "@axelar-network/axelarjs-sdk";

export class AxelarJSSDKFacade {

    private static environment: string;
    private static axelarJsSDK: TransferAssetBridge;

    constructor(environment: string) {
        AxelarJSSDKFacade.environment = environment;
        AxelarJSSDKFacade.axelarJsSDK = new TransferAssetBridge(AxelarJSSDKFacade.environment);
    }

    public static async transferAssets(payload: IAssetTransferObject, sourceCbs: ICallbackStatus, destCbs: ICallbackStatus): Promise<IAssetInfoWithTrace> {

        try {
            return AxelarJSSDKFacade.axelarJsSDK.transferAssets(payload, sourceCbs, destCbs, false);
        } catch (e: any) {
            sourceCbs?.failCb();
            throw e;
        }
    }

}
```

For instantiation:
```tsx

const environment = "devnet"; /*environment must be one of local | devnet | testnet*/

new AxelarJSSDKFacade(environment);

```
